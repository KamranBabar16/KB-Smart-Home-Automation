# KB Smart Home Automation Using NodeMCU

In this IoT project, you control any electrical appliances with the help of Google assistant & Amazon's Alexa.
I have written the code in a way so that if Internet/Wi-Fi gets disconnected or not available, and the relay control from Web Page, IR Remote will go on independent of Wi-Fi.
A lot of commercial devices already exist in the market for such application but, I wanted to have my own simple and low-cost device and itâ€™s always fun to learn new things. :)

<br />

**Features**

- Control over Internet from anywhere in the world
- Voice Control using Google Assistant & Alexa
- Control from Blynk App
- Control from any IR remote
-	Control over Web Page
-	Save the switch state even after micro controller restarts.

<br />

**If you lose Internet Connection**
- You won't be able to control over internet and from Blynk, Google Assistant and Alexa.
- Web Page and IR Remote will work.	

**If you lose Wi-Fi Connection**
- Only IR Remote will work.
- Internet and Wi-Fi connection will be restored automatically if disconnected.
